My Personal Website
===================

This is the source code for my [personal website](http://dangmai.net). It's built on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), but with no cache-bursting (the website itself is just a static page, so cache-bursting would be overkill).

The website uses [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/) for dependency management, so before deploying you should remember to run:

```
bower install
```

in order to install the frontend vendor libraries.
